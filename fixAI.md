Running command `Open VS Code Settings`

## Troubleshooting Steps for Your Upstairs Laptop:

### 1. **Check VS Code & Copilot Versions**
- Open VS Code on your upstairs laptop
- Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
- Search for "GitHub Copilot" and check if it's installed and up-to-date
- Also check "GitHub Copilot Chat" extension
- Update both if they're outdated

### 2. **Verify Copilot Settings**
- Open VS Code Settings (Ctrl+,)
- Search for "copilot"
- Ensure these are enabled:
  - `github.copilot.enable` → ✅ Enabled
  - `github.copilot.editor.enableAutoCompletions` → ✅ Enabled  
  - `github.copilot.chat.enabled` → ✅ Enabled

### 3. **Check Workspace Trust**
- If you see a "Workspace not trusted" banner, click it and trust the workspace
- Copilot may be restricted in untrusted workspaces

### 4. **Restart VS Code & Sign In**
- Completely close VS Code
- Reopen and ensure you're signed into GitHub/Copilot
- Sometimes the authentication gets stale

### 5. **Check Language Support**
- Copilot works best with certain file types
- For JavaScript/TypeScript files, ensure the language mode is correct (bottom-right status bar)

### 6. **Network/Firewall Issues**
- Copilot requires internet access
- Check if your upstairs network has any restrictions
- Try disabling VPN if you're using one

### 7. **Extension Conflicts**
- Temporarily disable other AI/code completion extensions
- Restart VS Code and test Copilot

### 8. **Reset Copilot Settings**
If nothing works, try resetting:
- Open Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)
- Type "Developer: Reload Window" and select it
- Or completely uninstall/reinstall Copilot extensions

### 9. **Check VS Code Version**
- Ensure VS Code is up-to-date (Help → Check for Updates)
- Older versions may have compatibility issues

### 10. **System Differences**
Compare the two laptops:
- Operating system versions?
- VS Code installation method (system vs user)?
- User account permissions?

The fact that it works on this laptop but not upstairs suggests a configuration or environment difference rather than anything related to your interaction with the AI. Try the steps above, starting with checking versions and settings!
