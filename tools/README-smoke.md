Smoke-test for Visual GUI Designer

Open `tools/smoke-visualgui.html` in the Nebula renderer (or a browser) to manually verify:

- Double-click a label to edit inline
- Double-click a path to add a midpoint
- Drag midpoint handles (if implemented) to reposition

How to open in the app:

1. Run the app (e.g., `npm start`).
2. File -> Open... or load the file into a webview panel.

Or open directly in a browser for basic behavior checks.
