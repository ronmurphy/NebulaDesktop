- ✅ **Vertical Tab Browser**: Professional browser with webview integration, tab management
- ✅ **Basic File Manager**: File system navigation (currently mock data)
- ✅ **Window System**: Drag & drop, minimize/maximize/close, multi-window support
- ✅ **Nebula Theme System**: CSS variables, consistent design language
- ✅ **Settings App**: Basic configuration with wallpaper color theming and saving
- ✅ **Launcher**: Grid-based app launcher with search functionality
