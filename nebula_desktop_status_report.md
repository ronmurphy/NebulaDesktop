# NebulaDesktop v4 Status Report & v5 Development Plan

## Project Overview

**NebulaDesktop** is a ChromeOS-like Electron desktop environment built with vanilla JavaScript. It provides a modern, web-focused computing experience with glassmorphism design and modular applications.

### Core Philosophy
- **Web-first computing** - Designed for users who primarily work in browsers
- **Modular architecture** - Each app is self-contained and independently developed
- **Modern aesthetics** - Glassmorphism UI with smooth animations
- **Lightweight** - Vanilla JavaScript, no heavy frameworks

## Current Status (v4) ✅

### **Working Features**
- ✅ **Desktop Environment**: Complete shell with taskbar, launcher, window management
- ✅ **Vertical Tab Browser**: Professional browser with webview integration, tab management
- ✅ **Basic File Manager**: File system navigation (currently mock data)
- ✅ **Window System**: Drag & drop, minimize/maximize/close, multi-window support
- ✅ **Nebula Theme System**: CSS variables, consistent design language
- ✅ **Settings App**: Basic configuration with wallpaper color theming and saving
- ✅ **Launcher**: Grid-based app launcher with search functionality
- ✅ **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Alt+Space (launcher), Alt+Tab (window switching)
- ✅ **Session Persistence**: Settings and state saved to localStorage

## Next Steps

1. **Create comprehensive backup** of current v4 codebase
2. **Begin Phase 1 integration** starting with Enhanced-main.js
3. **Test terminal functionality** thoroughly before proceeding
4. **Document any issues** encountered during integration
5. **Prepare for Phase 2** once Phase 1 is stable
