Why this is broken:
The Pro version was written assuming a different LayerManager interface than what's actually implemented. The code has:

Wrong method names (setMainCanvas vs setCanvas)
Missing methods (setCanvasSize)
Improper initialization order
DOM access issues
TDZ problems from class loading order
The real solution:
As you said, tell the developer to completely rewrite this using the NebulaApp template as a strict guideline. The template provides:

Proper initialization sequence
Correct WindowManager integration
Proper DOM element handling
Correct manager interfaces
Proper event handling
The current code is trying to do too much custom logic instead of following the established patterns. A clean rewrite following the template would eliminate all these issues at once.

Try running it now - the immediate errors should be gone, but the underlying architectural problems remain. A proper template-based rewrite is definitely needed!
